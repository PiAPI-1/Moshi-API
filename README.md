# Moshi API
Check out PiAPI's [Moshi API](https://piapi.ai/moshi-api) - enabing your application with natural and expressive conversational interactions with AI!

As you know, Moshi is developed by the French [Kyutai](https://kyutai.org/) team, and is touted as the most advanced competitor to [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s GPT-4o. Their real-time multimodal AI is very fast and enables natural, conversational interactions between users and the model, allowing users to speak and listen simultaneously for a more engaging experience. And most importantly, their research team announced that the code and model weights will soon be freely available for all!

Thus, for us at PiAPI, with our mission to be the go-to platform for all generative AI APIs, we are uniquely positioned to offer Moshi API alongside our other generative AI services, leveraging our extensive user base and expertise in model hosting and inferencing. 

So if you are interested in integrating Moshi into your app, please sign up for our waitlist at [PiAPI](https://piapi.ai/moshi-api)!

The Moshi API will be available shortly after the Kyutai Team releases the parameters of the model. Once available, the PiAPI team will deploy the models on our server clusters and offer the API service to developers. We will also scale our inference capacity to handle increasing demand. 

While we don't have the final pricing details yet, we anticipate using a usage-based pricing model similar to our other generative AI APIs. Users will likely purchase credits and be charged based on the number of input and output tokens per API call, following the Pay-as-you-go approach.

<br>

PiAPI optimizes our server cluster to maximize speed and minimize latency. Response times will vary based on factors like:
- Current workload
- Input token length
- Queue priority
